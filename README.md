# Next_Word_Predication_On_LSTM_Project
Build a Next Word Prediction model using LSTM. Train on text data, tokenize words, and create input-output sequences. Use an embedding layer, LSTM layers, and a dense softmax layer for prediction. Train with cross-entropy loss and evaluate with accuracy and BLEU score. Generate words based on input text.
